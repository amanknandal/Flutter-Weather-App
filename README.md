# Flutter-Weather-App
This static weather app, built with Flutter, showcases weather details using hardcoded data. It features a clean, responsive design with weather information like temperature and humidity, along with icons representing different conditions. Ideal for design prototypes, it demonstrates Flutter's UI capabilities without live data.
